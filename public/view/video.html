  <h2 class="title">Line Skis '10 Team Video<h2>
  <br />
  <div class="video-description">
      The Line Skis Mountain Command Team is a mix of the most talented, unique and individual skiers in the world. How can a bunch of individuals be a team you ask? Their creativity is the bond that connects them, driving the voice of our brand and beating the drum of new ways to look at the mountain, the streets, backcountry and everywhere in between. We're proud of these riders who every day bring something new to all aspects of skiing. Where there's snow and enough room to slide on it, you'll find Line MCs. Enjoy the edit and please purchase/download/watch the films in the list at the end to support the companies that support these riders and help push skiing to new levels.

  <br />
  <div class="video-description">
      John "LJ" Strenio has been with Line forever. We've grown with this guy since his humble days at Smuggler's Notch and the urban rails in Vermont, to now traveling the world shredding powder in Japan with Meatheads, jumps in Sweden at JOSS, urban in Canada with Poorboyz and everywhere else in between. Enjoy this edit created by LJ himself.
